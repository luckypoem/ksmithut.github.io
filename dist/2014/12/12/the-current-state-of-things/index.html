most recent technologies that I am working with.</p>
<p>I own a MacBook Pro that I bought nearly two and a half years ago. It’s
currently running Mac OS X Yosemite. Surprisingly, it runs just as fast or
faster than when I originally purchased it. Some of that is due to the advances
in OS X, but I’ve also kept it pretty clean, doing clean installs every nine
months or so.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, I won’t try to convince you to “Apple all the things” or anything
like that. It’s not a religion, although I know some people who treat it as
such. The first time I got a Mac, I considered myself a heavy Windows user. I
didn’t have anything against Mac; I only really knew Windows. My parents got
me a MacBook Pro 13” for school. I put a Windows partition on it for my Windows
stuff, and used OS X for design, and a little bit of development.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve stopped using Windows for work related stuff and have gone
full, Mac. The main reason being that about two-thirds of the web runs on Linux.
I needed better Unix support as well as pretty good access to design programs.
Turns out that Mac is a good cross between the two. There are some pretty good
shell programs to give you some good linux support, though.</p>
<p>I currently work full-time as a web developer working on all sorts of projects.
At my job, I help maintain some wordpress stuff, but spend most of my time
working on conversion optimization development and tying in our wordpress sites
into our backend systems that run on Ruby. I don’t do much Ruby, but I am able
parse through it enought to get around.</p>
<p>For side-projects (mostly personal projects), I mostly use Node.js. I use
Node.js for a lot of web asset build processes for a lot of my work projects.
I’ve built some web scraping tools and template builders for some quick work
projects, as well. I currently maintain 16 <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/~ksmithut">npm
modules</a> (might be more or less when you read
this). Some are used more than others, but all of them stemmed from a personal
need.</p>
<p>I’ve recently wanted to start looking more into <a href="https://golang.org/"><code>go</code></a>, but
haven’t had the time with all of my work and school. I’m hoping to have some
time during next semester to get more into it.</p>
<p>My text editor of choice is <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. I’m a big fan of how
configurable and pluggable it is. I own a license for Sublime Text 2, which I
also enjoy using for things that Atom can’t quite handle just yet (Atom hasn’t
reached 1.x yet). I’ve used full on IDEs for web development (like Titanium
Studio), but I always spent more time configuring my environment for every
project than I liked. I also ran into all sorts of <code>git</code> trouble trying to
manage branching, merge conflicts, and all that good stuff. I’ve since switched
to just using git in the Terminal.</p>
<p>My usual development setup is Chrome open on one desktop screen, Terminal open
in another, and Atom open on the third. I like to think that it’s pretty
minimalistic, but I know I could go further if I made the leap to vim.</p>
<p>My setup and opinions of technology will most likely change by this time next
year. It will be interesting to look back and wonder, “What was I thinking?”.</p>
