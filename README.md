# ksmithut.github.io

You must have node installed in order to build this.

In order to do a new build:
```
npm install -g bower
git clone https://github.com/ksmithut/ksmithut.github.io.git
cd ksmithut.github.io
npm install
npm run build
```

After that, the `dist/` directory is the build version of the website.

Note: development on this is not active and will be replaced by something else in the future.
