I fell into a habit of indecisiveness, and nothing was ever done about it. I had
my share of inspirational moments when I thought to myself, &quot;I&#39;m just going to
buckle down and get it done!&quot; but alas, here I am, telling myself the same
thing.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a lack of ability (I don&#39;t think), but rather a lack of deciding, or
perhaps a lack of settling. Working in a technology field, I wanted by blog to
be using the latest and greatest with all the bells and whistles. I wanted to
show off all the stuff that I knew how to do with databases, back-end
frameworks, and front-end frameworks. It became a nightmare of this <code>TODO</code> item
that would always have to be redone. So I finally got sick of it all, and
decided to keep it simple (relatively speaking).</p>
<p>Before I get too deep into my decision making process, I need to give you some
context to my decision.</p>
<h2 id="introductions">Introductions</h2>
<p>Hi. My name is Keith. I am passionate about the web. I am a consumer of the web,
much like you, but I also <strong>build</strong> things for the web. I&#39;ve been building
things ever since I can remember, although back then it was mostly with Legos.
When asked if I would ever consider going into leadership or leading a
development team, I often answer that I like to build things too much. That
isn&#39;t to say that a leader of a development team wouldn&#39;t build stuff, but I
like getting into the meat of the process and architecture of a project.</p>
<p>This is perhaps why I had such a hard time deciding on a technology to stick
with.</p>
<p>When I first started out in my career, I was pretty much only familiar with
vanilla PHP and jQuery. I wasn&#39;t going to roll out any custom blog platform
anytime soon with those skills. So I learned a little WordPress. I probably
knew enough to start a blog then, but I didn&#39;t want to become one of <em>those</em>
web developers. There&#39;s nothing wrong with WordPress developers, I just knew
a lot of developers like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/wordpress-all-the-things.png" alt="WordPress all the things" title="WordPress All The Things!"></p>
<p>As an intern at a digital agency, I was tasked with learning Drupal. They gave
me a giant book that was the definitive guide to Drupal 7 development. I worked
on other little side projects while I was &quot;learning&quot; Drupal, but they were
preparing me for a larger project. If you&#39;ve ever tried to learn Drupal before,
you&#39;ve probably run into a situation like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/cms-drupal-learning-curve.jpg" alt="Drupal learning curve is steep" title="Drupal Learning Curve"></p>
<p>I too ran into this love-hate relationship with Drupal. However, it was flexible
enough to accomodate most any need, plus a lot of the agency&#39;s web clients
specifically asked for Drupal, which is why they needed me to catch on quick.</p>
<p>Every project, I learned something new and great about Drupal. I was a convert.
Drupal just seemed like such a good fit for everything, why not my blog? Well,
I actually started doing it in Drupal, but then I found out that Drupal 8 was
coming out soon (which at the time of writing this, it still hadn&#39;t come out).
Any major version upgrade for most CMSs would require a very big restructuring
because modules/plugins aren&#39;t updated, or the core software now contains some
of the popular plugins with slightly different APIs. It was going to be a
nightmare trying to keep up.</p>
<p>I actually started the development of my blog with a pre-alpha version of
Drupal. But I got distracted by school, work, and family obligations, so there
it lived, until I finally deleted the folder that contained my work.</p>
<h2 id="node-js">Node.js</h2>
<p>Right before I left work at that agency, I was getting pretty heavy into
<a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a>. I instantly fell in love with it. This was a huge
turning point in my development career/hobby. I&#39;ll likely get more into that in
a different blog post though.</p>
<p>Long story short, from then until now, a lot of my free-time has been spent
developing and maintaining node modules. I know it&#39;s not the fasted platform,
but it&#39;s fast enough. I&#39;ve actually never used it for any professional projects
yet, but it&#39;s used in most of my asset build processes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done a ton of <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a> and a ton of
<a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a>, and a little of a few others. I&#39;ll rant more on
those at a later time, but it suffices to say that I&#39;m using gulp right now for
most of my projects.</p>
<h2 id="here-and-now">Here and now</h2>
<p>That&#39;s what brings me to now. I&#39;ve decided to build a static site generator (or
rather a build process) to build my blog/portfolio website. I may change it in
the future, but for now, it seems like the best pick. It&#39;s all open source, and
you can view all of the source code
<a href="https://github.com/ksmithut/ksmithut.github.io">here</a>. You&#39;re welcome to fork
it, pull request, make your own site, whatever.</p>
<p>With static site generation, you have no back-end dependency, other than
an http server. Also, load times can be dramatically improved because you don&#39;t
have any back-end parsing or processing.</p>
<p>Another big bonus is that I can host it using github pages, which as long as
it&#39;s open source, it&#39;s free.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also considered using other static site generator type stuff like
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">wintersmith</a> or
<a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">metalsmith</a>, but I decided against them. Jekyll
wasn&#39;t really my thing because ruby and I have a very complicated relationship.
I tried wintersmith and metalsmith, but metalsmith was still in it&#39;s early
stages and didn&#39;t have the asset pipeline I wanted and wintersmith had a bit of
a learning curve for me to get used to.</p>
<p>The process I&#39;m using is custom, but it&#39;s using gulp. Take a look at my
repo and the gulpfile, and you&#39;ll see what I mean. I still hadn&#39;t completely
worked everything out in the build process at the time of writing this post, but
I knew that if I didn&#39;t start writing soon, this would become another abandoned
project.</p>
<p>The content is written in
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a> with yaml
<a href="http://assemble.io/docs/YAML-front-matter.html">front matter</a>. I wrote a gulp
plugin to auto generate paginated &#39;archive&#39;, category, and tag listings. As the
project develops, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll add more to it.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is the beginning of something substantial when it comes to my
blogging.</p></div></section><div class="footer inverse"><div class="container"><p>&copy; Keith Smith 2014</p></div></div><script src="/js/main.0.0.0.min.js"></script></body></html>
