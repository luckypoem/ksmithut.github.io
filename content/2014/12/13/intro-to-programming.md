I first got started programming in High School. It was a fairly new class, and
only offered at one time. Looking back, the teacher reminding me a bit of Steve
Wosniak in appearance. We started out programming Lego Mindstorms robots. It
wasn't 'coding' per se, but was is working out logic paths and such. We quickly
moved onto Doctor Scheme, which is a very high level language. I don't remember
anything about it. At all. But it was easy to build out little functions that
did simple things.

The first real language we used was Java. I was very intimidated. There was a
lot of magic happening and I didn't understand what a lot of the keywords did.
Everytime I started a project, I wondered: "What does `public static void main`
even mean?". I asked my teacher this a couple time during the class, but he just
said to just accept that it works for now and that we'd get into it during the
second and third year courses. I was frustrated, but now that I know what they
mean, I'm glad that he didn't attempt to explain it.

## When you begin

When you first start programming, it's important to keep yourself motivated.
Working on your own projects, your own ideas, is a great start! Think of
program that can keep track of things for you, or do some monotonous calculation
for you. Don't worry about "the best language" or "the best process". Just pick
something you're comfortable with and do it.

You'll probably run into more experienced programmers that will try to convince
you of the best language or best library to use. It is much better to build in
something you're comfortable with when you're starting out. There are a lot of
rabbits to chase in software development. Don't worry about chasing the "right"
one just yet.

Philip Guo said it best when
[he stated](http://pgbovine.net/programmers-talking-to-beginners.htm):

> If you're a programmer, please don't denigrate what a beginner is currently
> learning ... unless you're willing to personally invest the enormous amount of
> time to ensure that they learn what you want them to learn. Just making a
> snide drive-by remark about how their choice of languages or tools isn't as
> cool as what you use will likely drain their motivation.

Guo's advice is directed towards more experienced developers giving advice to
those just beginning, but it's important to keep in mind if you're just
beginning your development journey. People *will* tell you that your choice of
programming language is crap. Although I think it's important to step out of
your comfort zone to learn new things, some of the basic concepts of programming
should be grasped in a familiar environment.

## How to keep up with new trends

Once you've gotten into programming a bit and taking a little swim in the
development community, you may wonder, "What's next?" You will undoubtedly learn
that there is virtually an infinite number of "nexts" when it comes to
technology. There is always a new language coming about. Always a new library
being developed. Always just as often a library, language, or API being
deprecated and unsupported. You will have to be in a constant state of learning
to be successful in this field.

There are some helpful resources that I use to keep up to date with all things
development:

* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) - This is one I check daily.
I have been known to be addicted to this feed, checking back even after 5
minutes. I have had to discipline myself with this one because there are some
good (and bad) articles that show up here. Some big world events seem to show up
here as well. The cool thing about this one is that the current, most popular
items tend to make their way up to the top of the list.

* [Echo JS](http://www.echojs.com/latest/0) - This is more geared towards web
development and JavaScript specifically. Sometimes that same thing shows up on
both this list and Hacker News. This one doesn't get quite as many articles,
but it does get some good stuff.

* [Code Tuts+](http://code.tutsplus.com/) - This is a site that offers tutorials
on how to do a variety of things in various coding environments. It doesn't get
updated too often, but this was pretty much my goto place to learn new things
when I started programming professionally.

There are tons of other lists of helpful article feeds out there. Go out, find
your favorite, and get involved!
