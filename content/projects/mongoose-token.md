[mongoose-token](https://github.com/ksmithut/mongoose-token) is a
[mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) plugin that makes it easy to set one-time
use tokens to a model for things like password resets and one time logins.

It's pretty easy to implement, and fairly flexible. Reduces some complex code
to a few simple and easy to understand methods.
