[mongoose-pass](https://github.com/ksmithut/mongoose-pass) is a
[mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) plugin that adds an easy way to add a
password property to your models, typically user models. It hashes the password
field for you using the [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) module,
and provides an easy-to-use authentication method when building password
authentication middleware.
